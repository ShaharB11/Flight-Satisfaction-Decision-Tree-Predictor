# Flight Satisfaction Classifier

A custom Decision Tree implementation built from scratch in Python to predict passenger satisfaction.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to classification without using external libraries like Scikit-Learn. It implements core AI concepts including:
* **Information Gain & Entropy** for optimal splitting.
* **Chi-Square Pruning** to handle noise and prevent overfitting.
* **K-Fold Cross-Validation** for robust performance evaluation.

## Why "From Scratch"?
While libraries like Scikit-Learn are standard, this implementation shows a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics and logic of tree-based models.

## How to Run
1. Ensure `flights.csv` is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run `python decision_tree.py`.
